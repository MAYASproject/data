# EMG Envelope-Type Signals

Measurements were taken using the **"EMG Raw Signal Collection Kit"** electrical muscle sensor module. The acquired signal was of the **envelope type**, not the raw signal (see Figure 1).

## Electrode Placement

For sEMG signal recording, three electrodes per channel were used (in this case, only one channel was necessary, so three electrodes were employed in total):  
- Two **active electrodes**, placed over the muscle belly.  
- One **reference electrode**, positioned below the two active electrodes.

This configuration helps obtain a cleaner signal compared to random electrode placement over the muscle and a reference electrode placed in an irrelevant anatomical region.

The inter-electrode distance was set to **20 millimeters**, and the electrodes were aligned **parallel to the muscle fibers** to optimize signal acquisition. Surface foam monitoring electrodes from **3M with conductive gel** were used for this purpose.

The following muscle locations were selected for signal acquisition:
- **Extensor digitorum**
- **Palmaris longus**
- **Flexor digitorum profundus**
- **Biceps brachii**

Among these, the **extensor digitorum** and **palmaris longus** muscles were the most consistently active during measurements.
